Project Title: PilgrimPath: AI-powered Mobility & Crowd Management for Simhastha 2028
Team ID: TH11541

1. Overview
PilgrimPath is a user-friendly web and mobile platform designed to enhance safe, smooth, and inclusive journeys for millions of pilgrims at Simhastha 2028. Using AI, live data, and a multilingual chatbot, our solution helps pilgrims navigate crowded routes, book transport/accommodation, and access quick help, while giving organizers full control over crowd and incident management.

2. Problem & Solution
Problem Statement:
Simhastha 2028 is expected to host 20+ million pilgrims, leading to severe crowd congestion, delayed routes, language barriers, slow emergency response, and difficulties in booking essential services.
Solution:
PilgrimPath uses AI for real-time route planning and crowd avoidance, provides multilingual (Hindi/Tamil/English) support, and integrates transport/accommodation booking. Organizers receive live incident reports, analytics, and can coordinate faster emergency responses.

3. Logic & Workflow

Data Collection: Crowd sensors, GPS, CCTV feeds, user incident reports, live event data.

Processing: ML engine predicts crowd density, optimizes routes, and triggers alerts. Map APIs, booking APIs, and chatbot/NLP layer handle inputs and outputs.

Output:

User Side: Pilgrims get safe route suggestions, real-time alerts, booking options, and multilingual support via web/mobile app.

Admin Side: Organizers use a dashboard to see incidents, live analytics, assign help, and review system status.

4. Tech Stack

Frontend: React Native (mobile), ReactJS (web), TypeScript

Backend: Node.js, Python (FastAPI)

Map APIs: Google Maps, OpenStreetMap

ML: Python (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn)

Voice/NLP: Google Dialogflow, Azure Speech APIs

Data Storage: Firebase, PostgreSQL

5. Future Scope
The prototype can be scaled with advanced AI modules, full mobile app support, offline alerts, volunteer management, and adoption for other religious/city events. Planned upgrades include multi-user support, health analytics, and local government integration for wider impact.
